[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/649769899.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/649769899)

This repository contains code to reproduce the main results presented in the [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.26.497606v1.abstract) titled *The assembly yield of complex, heterogeneous structures: A computational toolbox.*
This code requires a previous version of JAX -- JAX Version 0.2.25.
This code also relies on the `jax_transformations3d` library developed by Carl Goodrich (see [GitHub page](https://github.com/cpgoodri/jax_transformations3d)).
Included in each directory is a snapshot of a prevoius version of this library that is compatible with our code.

Currently, our model is not available in the form of a standalone python package.
However, given sufficient demand, we will develop such a package.
Please contact [ryan_krueger@g.harvard.edu](mailto:ryan_krueger@g.harvard.edu) or [brenner@seas.harvard.edu](mailto:brenner@seas.harvard.edu) if you are interested in using our model and would like to collaborate.

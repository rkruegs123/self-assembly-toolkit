# proteins

This code is made available to reproduce the results presented in Figures 3 and 4 of our manuscript for a given concentration and value of $\epsilon$.
To run the code, use the following command: `python3 compute.py --mode [PFL or TRAP] -D EPS_VAL -c CONCENTRAITON` where a mode of `PFL` corresponds to Figure 3 and a mode of `TRAP` corresponds to Figure 4.
